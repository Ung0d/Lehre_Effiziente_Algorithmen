    "Consider the problem of cutting steel rods into pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets assume we produce steel rods of length $n$ meters and we have a machine that is able to cut them into smaller pieces. We can only cut at integer positions i.e. at $1,2,3,\\dots$ meters. We can cut up to $n-1$ times and each cut is free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a table of prices $p_i$ for steel rods of length $i$, determine the maximum revenue and the corresponding cutting positions one can obtain by selling the pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- if $p_n$ is large enough an optimal solution could be not cutting at all\n",
    "- there are $2^{n-1}$ ways of cutting each rod since each position is independent, we can therefore not try all\n",

You have a method than breaks a string at a single position and since it has to copy all characters it has cost $n$. When breaking at more than one position, the number of copy operations depends on the ordering of the breaks. For instance, breaking a string of length 20 at 2, 8, 10 requires 50 copy operations whereas 10, 8, 2 only requires 38.\n",
